Pathway analysis of 1q21.3 genes

This pathway analysis uses pathfindR and RectomePA packages.

This project opened 23.01.19 and is part of the RORC Gains Bioinformatics 11.01.19 Project.

For PEA using pathfindR (KEGG) use the data in PEA_KEGG_Results (Run 2) and NOT the data in (pathfindR_PA -> PEA_KEGG_Results), although this is where the script and original input data lives.
